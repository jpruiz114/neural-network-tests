# Linear Regression Implementation

This folder contains a pure NumPy implementation of linear regression using gradient descent. This serves as a fundamental machine learning example that demonstrates core concepts used in neural networks.

## What This Code Does

The `LinearRegressionTest1.py` script demonstrates:

1. **Data Generation**: Creates synthetic data with a known linear relationship `y = 4 + 3x + noise`
2. **Gradient Descent**: Implements gradient descent algorithm to learn the optimal parameters
3. **Visualization**: Plots the original data points and the learned regression line
4. **Parameter Recovery**: Shows how well the algorithm recovers the true parameters

## Mathematical Foundation

### Understanding the Line Equation

The synthetic data follows the equation:
```
y = 4 + 3x + noise
```

This is equivalent to the standard linear equation form:
```
y = b + mx
```

Where:
- **b = 4**: The y-intercept (value of y when x = 0)
- **m = 3**: The slope (how much y changes for each unit change in x)
- **x**: The input variable
- **noise**: Random variation added to make the data realistic

**Note**: In our equation `y = 4 + 3x + noise`:
- `4` represents the intercept (b)
- `3x` represents the slope (m) multiplied by x
- The goal is for our algorithm to learn these values: θ₀ ≈ 4 and θ₁ ≈ 3

### Linear Model
The linear regression model predicts output `y` using the equation:
```
y = θ₀ + θ₁x = θᵀX
```
Where:
- `θ₀` is the intercept (bias)  
- `θ₁` is the slope (weight)
- `X` is the input feature matrix with added bias column

### Cost Function (Loss Function)
The algorithm minimizes the Mean Squared Error (MSE):
```
J(θ) = (1/2m) * Σ(hθ(x⁽ⁱ⁾) - y⁽ⁱ⁾)²
```
*Note: "Cost function" and "loss function" are often used interchangeably. Technically, the loss function measures error for a single example, while the cost function is the average loss over the entire training set.*

### Gradient Descent Update Rule
Parameters are updated iteratively using either of these equivalent forms:

**Vector Notation:**
```
θ = θ - α * ∇J(θ)
```

**Partial Derivative Notation:**
```
θ = θ - α * ∂J(θ)/∂θ
```

Where:
- `α` is the learning rate
- `∇J(θ)` is the gradient vector (contains all partial derivatives)
- `∂J(θ)/∂θ` represents the partial derivative of the cost function with respect to θ

**Explanation of Both Forms:**
- **∇J(θ)** (nabla): Vector notation representing the gradient - a vector containing all partial derivatives
- **∂J(θ)/∂θ**: Explicit partial derivative notation showing the rate of change of J with respect to each parameter
- Both forms are mathematically equivalent; the gradient ∇J(θ) is simply the vector of all partial derivatives

**For Our Linear Regression Case:**
Since we have two parameters (θ₀ and θ₁), the partial derivative form expands to:
```
θ₀ = θ₀ - α * ∂J(θ)/∂θ₀
θ₁ = θ₁ - α * ∂J(θ)/∂θ₁
```

### Gradient Derivation: From MSE to Implementation

**Starting with the MSE Cost Function:**
```
J(θ) = (1/2m) * Σᵢ₌₁ᵐ (hθ(x⁽ⁱ⁾) - y⁽ⁱ⁾)²
```
Where `hθ(x⁽ⁱ⁾) = θ₀ + θ₁x⁽ⁱ⁾` (our prediction for sample i)

**In Matrix Form:**
```
J(θ) = (1/2m) * ||X_b·θ - y||²
J(θ) = (1/2m) * (X_b·θ - y)ᵀ(X_b·θ - y)
```

**Taking the Derivative:**
To find ∂J(θ)/∂θ, we use the chain rule:
```
∂J(θ)/∂θ = ∂/∂θ[(1/2m) * (X_b·θ - y)ᵀ(X_b·θ - y)]
```

**Step-by-Step Differentiation:**

1. **Start with the cost function in matrix form:**
   ```
   J(θ) = (1/2m) * (X_b·θ - y)ᵀ(X_b·θ - y)
   ```

2. **Apply the matrix calculus rule for quadratic forms:**
   ```
   ∇θ[(Aθ−b)ᵀ(Aθ−b)] = 2Aᵀ(Aθ−b)
   ```
   Where `A = X_b` and `b = y`

3. **Calculate the gradient:**
   ```
   ∇J(θ) = (1/2m) * 2 * X_bᵀ * (X_b·θ - y) = (1/m) * X_bᵀ * (X_b·θ - y)
   ```

**Final Gradient Formula:**
```
∂J(θ)/∂θ = (1/m) * X_bᵀ * (X_b·θ - y)
```

**Code Implementation:**
The code matches our mathematical derivation:
```python
gradients = 1/m * X_b.T.dot(X_b.dot(theta) - y)
```

**Why This Derivation Matters:**
- Shows that gradient descent isn't magic - it's pure calculus
- Explains where the `X_b.T.dot(...)` formula comes from
- Demonstrates how we systematically find the direction of steepest descent

## Implementation Details

| Feature | Value | Purpose |
|---------|-------|---------|
| **Data Points** | 100 samples | Sufficient for stable learning |
| **True Parameters** | θ₀=4, θ₁=3 | Known ground truth |
| **Learning Rate** | 0.1 | Balanced convergence speed |
| **Iterations** | 1000 | Ensure full convergence |
| **Noise Level** | Standard normal | Realistic data simulation |

## Code Breakdown: Gradient Descent Implementation

The core gradient descent loop in the code:
```python
# Gradient Descent
for i in range(iterations):
    gradients = 1/m * X_b.T.dot(X_b.dot(theta) - y)
    theta -= learning_rate * gradients
```

**Line-by-Line Explanation:**

1. **`for i in range(iterations):`**
   - Repeats the optimization process for 1000 iterations
   - Each iteration improves the parameter estimates

2. **`X_b.dot(theta)`** (part of line 2)
   - Matrix multiplication: X_b × θ 
   - Calculates current predictions: ŷ = θ₀ + θ₁x for all data points
   - This is our model's current guess

3. **`X_b.dot(theta) - y`** (part of line 2)
   - Calculates prediction errors: (predictions - actual_values)
   - Shows how far off our current model is for each data point

4. **`X_b.T.dot(X_b.dot(theta) - y)`** (part of line 2)
   - Matrix multiplication: X_b^T × (prediction_errors)
   - Computes the gradient direction for each parameter
   - X_b.T is the transpose of X_b

5. **`1/m * X_b.T.dot(X_b.dot(theta) - y)`**
   - Scales by 1/m (where m=100 is number of samples)
   - The "1/m" averages the gradient over all training examples
   - This matches our mathematical derivation exactly

6. **`theta -= learning_rate * gradients`**
   - Updates parameters: θ_new = θ_old - α × gradient
   - Moves parameters in direction that reduces cost
   - learning_rate (α = 0.1) controls step size

**What's Happening Mathematically:**
- **Prediction**: Calculate ŷ = X_b × θ
- **Error**: Find difference between predictions and actual values  
- **Gradient**: Compute ∂J(θ)/∂θ = (1/m) × X_b^T × (ŷ - y)
- **Update**: Move parameters opposite to gradient direction

The gradient points in the direction of *steepest increase* in cost, so moving in the *opposite direction* (subtracting the gradient) reduces the cost function, gradually improving our model's accuracy.

## Possible Extensions

1. **Multiple Features**: Extend to multivariate regression
2. **Regularization**: Add L1/L2 penalties  
3. **Different Optimizers**: SGD, Adam, etc.
4. **Learning Rate Scheduling**: Adaptive learning rates
5. **Cross Validation**: Model selection techniques

## Mathematical Intuition

The gradient descent algorithm works by:
1. Starting with random parameter guesses
2. Calculating how wrong the predictions are (cost/loss)
3. Computing which direction to adjust parameters (gradient)
4. Taking small steps in that direction (learning rate)
5. Repeating until convergence

This is exactly the same process neural networks use, just with more parameters and more complex functions!
